This app is made using Java Spring Boot for backend and React JS for frontend implementation. <br />
Appropriate API routes are developed that will be created according to the appropriate requirements that are given, as well as a React application that will be in charge of displaying data and interacting with users. Additionally, in terms of the database, I use PostgreSQL. <br />
Hooks and Pagination are also used in the development of this web application.
### Application module for renting books from a certain library. 
The module that would be used by a user with a role librarian, who would have several privileges:
1) To add new books that can be rented. <br />
2) Delete books that are no longer in good condition and will not be rented. <br />
3) To modify a certain entry for a book. <br />
4) To mark a certain book as rented. 
### More about the application requirements: 
1) All books are displayed on the home page (you can see the path: "/" & "/books").  <br />
2) An Edit, Delete, Mark As Taken button is provided for each book.  <br />
3) Click the Edit / Delete buttons to call the API and modify / delete the book accordingly.  <br />
4) At the click of the "Mark As Taken" button, you need to make a call to the API and accordingly reduce the number of availableCopies.  <br />
5) Additionally, there is an Add a new book button, which allows you to add a new book.  <br />
6) There is a header section which is actually a navigation menu. <br />
